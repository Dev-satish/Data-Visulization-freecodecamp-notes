# Add Classes With D3

Styling a lot of elements seperatly becomes difficult even for small apps.

It would really be great if we could add the classes directly and style them using various style properties.

For this D3 has has attr() method.

The attr() method works similar to style().

It takes a comma seperated values and callback function.

Now lets see how can we add a class of "container" to the attr() method.

Ex: .attr("class","Container");

Note: 

The above "class" parameter will always remain same whenever we want to add the class to the attr() method.

only the "container" will change with the name of the class you want to add.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:


<style>
  .bar {
    width: 25px;
    height: 100px;
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("div")
      // Add your code below this line

      .attr("class","bar");

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
