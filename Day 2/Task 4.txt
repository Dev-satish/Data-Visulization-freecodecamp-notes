Task 4 

# work with Dynamic data in D3

In the last 3 challenges we worked with displaying the data dynamically using data() and enter() methods.

the data() and enter() methods take the data set and, create a new DOM element for each entry in the data set.

These methods take a data set and, together with the append() method, create a new DOM element for each entry in the data set.


now what if you want to display the elements of the dataset ?

to do so, you have to just know that the .text() method also takes an argumet taht can display the elements in the dataset.

Ex: .text((h2) => h2);

In the above example he text method takes and argument h2 and using => (arrow) it refers the value bound with h2.


now we can also add text to the element, to do so you just have to use concatination property of D3.


Ex: .text((h2) => h2 + " USD");


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:


<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select("body").selectAll("h2")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("h2")
      // Add your code below this line

      .text((h2) => h2 +" USD" )
      // .text(h2))

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
