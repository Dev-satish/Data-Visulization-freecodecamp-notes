# Change styles based on data


D3 is about visualization and presentation of data.

It's likely you'll want to change the styling of elements based on the data. 

For example, you may want to color a data point blue if it has a value less than 20, and red otherwise. 

You can use a callback function in the style() method and include the conditional logic. The callback function uses the d parameter to represent the data point:

Ex: selection.style("color", (d) => {Logic});

We can also use other CSS properties in the style() method.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION: 

<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select("body").selectAll("h2")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("h2")
      .text((d) => (d + " USD"))
      // Add your code below this line

      .style('color', (h2) =>{ 
      if(h2>20)
      {
        return "green"
      }
        else
        {
          return "red"
        }
        });

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
