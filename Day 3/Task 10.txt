# learn about SVG's in D3

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Grpahics 

Here scalable means that if we zoom in the vector image, it wont appear pixelated, i enlarges with the display system weather it is a small mobile screen or a large TV display.

SVG's are used to make common vector images ( shapes ).

As we work with data representation in D3 we use SVG's a lot.

To create an SVG on a webpage the link and the SVG details must go in the " <svg> ... </svg> ".


Even when we use css properties like "vw" or "vh" or "percentage" css can also become scalable.

But in data visulization SVG's are more preffered and using them is concidered as a good practice.


In this challenge we have to append the svg node and also we have to set the height, width and margin of the svg node.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:

<style>
  svg {
    background-color: pink;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select("body")
                  // Add your code below this line

                  .append('svg')
                  .attr('width',w)
                  .attr('height',h);

                  // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
