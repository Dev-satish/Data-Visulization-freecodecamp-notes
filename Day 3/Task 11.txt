Task 11

# Display Shapes with SVG

In the previous challenge we created an SVG which had a background colour.

Now we have to create a shape to put in the svg area.

for creating a shape in the svg image such as rectangles and circles. 

They are used to display data.

For example, a rectangle (<rect>) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.

To specify the exact location of the svg shape we use "x" and "y" coordinate.

The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner.

Positive 'x' values push the shape to the right and positive for 'y' push the shapes down from the origin.

To place a shape in the middle of the 500 (width) x 100 (height) svg from last challenge, the x coordinate would be 250 and the y coordinate would be 50.


An SVG rect has four attributes. There are the x and y coordinates for where it is placed in the svg area. It also has a height and width to specify the size.

Now the challenge is to create a rectangular shape by passing it the values of the previous challenge.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:

<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select("body")
                  .append("svg")
                  .attr("width", w)
                  .attr("height", h)
                  // Add your code below this line

  .append('rect')
  .attr('x',0)
  .attr('y',0)
  .attr('height',100)
  .attr('width',25)

                  // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
