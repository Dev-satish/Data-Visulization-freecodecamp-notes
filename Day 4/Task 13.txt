Task 13

# Dynamically set the coordinates of each bar

In the last challange we created a rectangle and appended it in an svg element.

Unfortunately, they all stacked on top of each other.

The placement of rectangle is controlled by the values if x and y.

they tell D3 to start draw the drawing the shape in the svg area.

the last challenge as the coordinates has been set to 0, the bar was placed in the upper-left corner.

Now to set all the bars aligned we have to set the value of y at 0, and the value of x will change when we add new bar.

As we incrase the value the of x the bars will shift to right.

The attr() mathod accepts a callback function to dynamically set the attribute brom any data.

This call back function takes 2 arguments, one for the data point itself ( usually d ) and other for the index of the data point.

syntex : .attr("property",(d,i) => {...} )

Note : Do not use any kind of a loop or anything to iterate over each values of the dataset, recall the data() method does that work automatically.

now to add space between the bars we have to add return i * 30, in order to set the  value of x to 30.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:

<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select("body")
                  .append("svg")
                  .attr("width", w)
                  .attr("height", h);

    svg.selectAll("rect")
       .data(dataset)
       .enter()
       .append("rect")
       .attr("x", (d, i) => {
         // Add your code below this line

        return i * 30

         // Add your code above this line
       })
       .attr("y", 0)
       .attr("width", 25)
       .attr("height", 100);
  </script>
</body>
