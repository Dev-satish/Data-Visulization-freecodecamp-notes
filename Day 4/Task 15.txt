Task 15

# Invert SVG elements 


As you see in the previous challenge the bars were upside-down , well thats because the SVG uses x, y co-ordinates.

In SVG the origin point is in the upper left corner. an x co-ordinate of 0 places a shape on the left edge. 

A y co-ordinate of 0 place a shape on the top of the edge of the svg area.


So, Higher x values push the bars to the right whereas higher Y values pushes the bars down.

Now to make the bars upside we'll need to adjust the value of the y coordinate as well as he position or size of the SVG area.

The height of the SVG area is 100. If you have a data point of 0 in the set, you would want the bar to start at the bottom of the SVG area (not the top). To do this, the y coordinate needs a value of 100. If the data point value were 1, you would start with a y coordinate of 100 to set the bar at the bottom. Then you need to account for the height of the bar of 1, so the final y coordinate would be 99.


The y coordinate that is y = heightOfSVG - heightOfBar would place the bars right-side-up.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:

<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select("body")
                  .append("svg")
                  .attr("width", w)
                  .attr("height", h);

    svg.selectAll("rect")
       .data(dataset)
       .enter()
       .append("rect")
       .attr("x", (d, i) => i * 30)
       .attr("y", (d, i) => {
         // Add your code below this line

  return h - 3 * d

         // Add your code above this line
       })
       .attr("width", 25)
       .attr("height", (d, i) => 3 * d);
  </script>
</body>
