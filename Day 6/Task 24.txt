Task 24

# Create a Linear Scale with D3

we plotted scatter points and bars on the SVG by passing the coordinates 

but what if the coordinate values are grater then the SVG area then the points will be plotted outside the SVG area. 

In D3, there are scales to help plot data.

'scales' are functions that tell the program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG.

For example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG and you want to plot Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be in the billion or trillion-dollar range. You provide D3 a type of scale to tell it how to place the large GDP values into that 100x500-sized area.

It's unlikely you would plot raw data as-is. Before plotting it, you set the scale for your entire data set, so that the x and y values fit your SVG width and height.

D3 has several scale types. For a linear scale (usually used with quantitative data), there is the D3 method scaleLinear():

Syntax: const scale = d3.scaleLinear()

By default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is the same as the value of the output. A separate challenge covers how to change this.


CHALLENGE SOLUTION:

<body>
  <script>
    // Add your code below this line

    const scale = d3.scaleLinear(); // Create the scale here
    const output = scale(50); // Call scale with an argument here

    // Add your code above this line

    d3.select("body")
      .append("h2")
      .text(output)
      
  </script>
</body>
