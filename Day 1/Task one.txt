Task 1


ADDING DOCUMENTS ELEMENTS WITH D3 ( Data Driven Documents )

D3 has several methods that lets you add and change elements in your documents.

So there is a method that selects one element from the documents, the name of the method is "Select()".

The select() method takes an agrument "name" and returns the html node for the first element in the document that matches the name.


To find an element or an html node in the document we use " const anchor = d3.select("satish"); ".

now, in the above element of code "const" is a datatype, whereas "Anchor" is a veriable that stores the html node from the document. 

D3 is the part of the code that is used to access the D3 library and it's methods.




There are 2 more methods in the D3 library:

1) append();
2) text();

The append() method takes an argument that adds the element into the document selected.

The text() method is used to select the current text in the HTML node.

Example: 

		d3.select("Name of the main tag that you want to select.")
  		  .append(" Name the tag where you want to append the data ")
  		  .text("Enter the text that you want to add");

with d3 we can chain several methods togather in a row.



TASK 1 SOLUTION:

		
		D3.select("body")
		  .apppend("h1")
		  .text("Learning D3");
