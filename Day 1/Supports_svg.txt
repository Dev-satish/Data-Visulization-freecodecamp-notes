What are Svgs.

Svgs are vector images.

The images that are scalable ( Zoomable ) Without affecting the quality of the image.

These are high quality images which are easily editable.

No other image formats are this much scalable, other file formats loose quality at the time of there scaling.

Svg is an XML file Format. 

These file formats are good for printing and professional use.

SVG image are always in Pure XML format which can be easily handleable using HTML and CSS.

This file is an easily compressible file format.

Now to edit this image format in HTML we have 2 ways:

1) < img src="filename.svg", width="200" height="200" />

2) there is a new tag introduced in HTML5 known as svg tag.
	
	<svg width="100" height="100">
		<circle cx="50" cy="50" stroke="Green" stroke-width="4"/>

	similarly we can draw various shapes like square, rectangle, trangle etc.

	</svg>

Do not use svg's for multicolour photos, it is best for logo's and graphic work.
