Data : Data is a collection of raw facts and figures.

data is everywhere around us, but without any shape or context it dosen't mean much.

In data visulization we create graphs, charts and maps to present different types of data using D3.js library.

we'll also learn about JSON( Javascript Object Notation ), and how to work with data online using an API ( Application Programming Interface ).
